# 107e Surfers
107e Surfers is a simple skateboarding game for the Mango Pi inspired by the classic hit game, Subway Surfers. The player stands on a skateboard and moves between three lanes by tilting back and forth, which is read by a MPU-6050 gyroscope connected to the bottom of the skateboard. The game uses interrupts to constantly read the players position, and every 15 seconds obstacles spawn which the player must avoid. The player's score is the amount of time they stay alive, and at the end of the game the player's score is added to the leaderboard, depending on how long they were alive.

The graphics are controlled using model-view-controller. `game.c` contains module-level representations for the character, barriers, and code to randomly generate a given permutation of barriers that show up. The type of barrier (bee, fly, block) is also randomly generated.

Everything runs on bare metalâ€”no OS, no external libraries.
